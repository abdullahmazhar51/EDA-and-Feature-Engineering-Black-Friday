They have shared purchase summary of various customers of selected high volume products from last month. The dataset also contains the customer demographics (age, sex, marital_status,city_type, stay_in_current_city), product details(product_id, product category) and Total purchase amount from last month.

Now they want to build the model to predict the purchase amount of customer against the products which will help them to create personalize offers for customers against different product.
